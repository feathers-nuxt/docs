## Architecture

Can be considered data driven in architecture. There are, conceptually, two layers  
Relies on the capabilities of both **nuxt** and **feathers** to run on both the **browser** and **node**.

This is a **feathers** server using embeded **nuxt** middleware for building and rendering **UI** defined as **Vue** **SFC**s.

> Tip Building only happens when app runs in **development** mode. Ensure you build the client before starting server in **production** mode.

By default, **nuxt** is set to build in **universal** mode so that the resulting build is an **isomorphic**; it can be used by the embedded middleware to render a ***route*** as a **pwa** that supports client-side navigation. **feathers** being isomorphic as well provides access to backend service to the universal build during rendering on the server and to the rendered ***route*** during interactions on the browser. 

:::tip
When deploying client build using **f3** to a static content server - such as **now.sh**, **surge.sh**, **ghpages** - 
**nuxt build** will be invoked with the **mode** option set to ***spa***. The resulting build does not require and will not work with the embedded middleware but it supports client-side navigation.
:::

When a ***route*** in the **universal build** is rendered server side, the the server instance availed to ***nuxt resources*** is the actual Node.JS server. During client-side navigation, however, the available server instance is a proxy to the actual server over **webssocket** connection. The two instances have the same **API**.

Within ***nuxt resources*** the server instance can be accessed from **Vue** **SFC** script as **this.$store.app.api** or as **this.app.api** from **Vuex** store modules. It can also be accessed in your page middleware as well.

:::tip
It is recommended to externalize back-end services access logic outside components into store actions where you can access the server as **this.app.api**. However, there are other features of the back-end **api** that you may want to use in your components. For instance, **storyboard** logging (More on that below).

## nuxt within feathers

The content of **src/server** are processed by backpack are processed through **backpack** following configurations in declared under the key **backpack** in the file **f3.config**.  

**Backpack** handles file-watching, live-reloading, transpiling, and bundling targeting server so we can use awesome tools like [livescript](http://livescript.net/) or latest**EcmaScript** features. See [configuration options](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/backpack). 

In addition to standard **feathers** **server** resources, a middleware is included for leveraging **nuxt** on the server. It sets up **nuxt** for **server side rendering** and stashes the app instance in the context of every **request** so that it is accessible within **nuxtServerInit**.

> Tip Ensure that nuxt middleware is declared last and that middleware configuration is last to set up.

## feathers within nuxt

The contents of **src/client** are processed through **nuxt** following configurations in declared under the key **nuxt** in the file **f3.config** See [nuxt documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/).

In addition to the resources in a standard **nuxt** project,   **src/client** includes an extra folder called **api** containing a single file named **feathers.js** for initializing **feathers** on the frontend. 

The instance is available within **Vue** components as **this.$store.app.api** and within **Vuex** store modules as **this.app.api** to provide access to backend **services**.

> Tip Ensure that you first declare every service you intend to use in **api/feathers.js** 

When rendering is done server-side, **feathers-client**is never initialized. Instead, **feathers** server instance will be availed as stated above. 

:::tip
When rendering on the server, the instance of **feathers-client** passed to **nuxt** is setup to use **HTTP** transport while the instance used with the browser renderer is setup to use **WebSocket** transport. The two versions are, however, functionally equivalent.
