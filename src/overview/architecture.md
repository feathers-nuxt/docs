## Directory Structure
An application initialized using f3 will have the following directory stucture

```text

## Logical Structure
The application is is an express instance containg nuxt SSR middleware for serving ui routes and a feathers sub app for serving api routes.

### express app
Leveraging Feathers Express framework bindings to create and Express server that we attach nuxt and feathers as middleware.
```livescript
express = require '@feathersjs/express'
app = express! # simple express app to serve both ui and api routes
```

### feathers as express sub app
Because an Express app is valid middleware and a Feathers app is also an Express app - when used serverside -, we attach the api (feathers) server to the express app as a middleware under the namespace `api`. This ensures that only routes starting with /api/ will be processed by feathers and the rest are handled by nuxt.
```livescript
# app as declared above

api = require './api' # import feathers application
app.use '/api', api # include feathers as a namespaced sub app 
```

### nuxt as express middleware
Nuxt is set up as a simple express middleware to process routes which do NOT start with `/api/` in order to avoid conflict with api server routing.
```livescript
# app and api as declared above

nuxt = require './middleware' # nuxt SSR middleware
app.use nuxt api # include middleware for rendering nuxt routes
```
> Ensure that nuxt middleware is declared last

<!-- 

Can be considered data driven in architecture. There are, conceptually, two layers  
Relies on the capabilities of both **nuxt** and **feathers** to run on both the **browser** and **node**.

This is a **feathers** server using embeded **nuxt** middleware for building and rendering **UI** defined as **Vue** **SFC**s.

> Building only happens when app runs in **development** mode. Ensure you build the client before starting server in **production** mode.

By default, **nuxt** is set to build in **universal** mode so that the resulting build is an **isomorphic**; it can be used by the embedded middleware to render a ***route*** as a **pwa** that supports client-side navigation. **feathers** being isomorphic as well provides access to backend service to the universal build during rendering on the server and to the rendered ***route*** during interactions on the browser. 

:::tip
When deploying client build using **f3** to a static content server - such as **now.sh**, **surge.sh**, **ghpages** - 
**nuxt build** will be invoked with the **mode** option set to ***spa***. The resulting build does not require and will not work with the embedded middleware but it supports client-side navigation.
:::

Within ***nuxt resources*** the server instance can be accessed from **Vue** **SFC** script as **this.$store.app.api** or as **this.app.api** from **Vuex** store modules. It can also be accessed in your page middleware as well.
 -->

### feathers client within nuxt

Feathers client instance is accessible as `store.app.api` from nuxt context object or within **Vue** components as `this.$store.app.api` or within **Vuex** store modules as `this.app.api` to provide access to backend services within nuxt. All services you have setup on feathers feathers server are automatically available via feathers client under `store.app.api.services` object.

:::tip
When rendering on the server, the instance of **feathers-client** passed to **nuxt** is setup to use **HTTP** transport while the instance used with the browser renderer is setup to use **WebSocket** transport. The two instances are, however, functionally equivalent.

### feathers services as vuex modules
Use [feathers-vuex Service Module](https://feathers-plus.github.io/v1/feathers-vuex/service-module.html) to sets up feathers services as Vuex store modules.
